    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

3.  **Set up Firebase:**
    This project uses Firebase for authentication and database services. You'll need to create your own Firebase project.

    -   Enable **Authentication** (Email/Password provider).
    -   Set up **Firestore Database**.
    -   Get your Firebase project configuration keys.
    -   Update the `firebaseConfig` object in [firebase.ts](firebase.ts) with your own keys.

    ```typescript
    // filepath: firebase.ts
    // ...existing code...
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
      projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
      storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
      messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
    };
    // ...existing code...
    ```

### Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can run the application using the Expo CLI.

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

2.  **Run on a device or emulator:**
    -   Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device.
    -   Or, press `a` to run on an Android emulator, or `i` to run on an iOS simulator.
